# iterator
A simple Electron App MySQL iterator written in Nodejs and Angularjs. 

For various projects i have had to iterate through eiter text files or larger ammounts of data in a database. 
To help me with that i have previously used some crude Java applications i have written for the purpose, but i decided to try to write a more useful tool as a Electron application, to get to learn the Electron enviroment. 


Examine Database:

Iterate Text File

ToDo:

1. Adding option for NoSQL databases

2. Option for more than one insertion field in file iteration

3. Better support for remote SSL connections
